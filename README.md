## Executive summary

The current report validates the system of smart contracts called “Vesting” (located at [this directory](./ref_2022_07_05_simple/)) and confirms no bugs that can lead to losing or freezing of any funds, as well as to its improper distribution were discovered. The claim above is based on mathematical proving of things rather than on manual inspection that minimizes the chance of missing the potential threats.

Thus, the verifier recommends the Vesting system of smart contracts for moving into production.
